These are the original (taken from the Wayback Machine) which were removed from the Google API.
idk of these work but i couldn't find them for my life

## Usage
In Android Studio, navigate to the SDK Manager, and click SDK Update Sites.
Click the plus icon, and name the first "Chrome OS Repository" and paste this URL into it:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamecoreSRC/Archived-ChromeOS-XML/main/addon2-1.xml (might need a ?token= at the end of it, idk if that'll change when i finally set this to public)

Then, repeat this step, but name it "Chrome OS System Images" and use the link:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gamecoreSRC/Archived-ChromeOS-XML/main/sys-img2-1.xml

ChromeOS Device should now appear in the SDK Tools.
